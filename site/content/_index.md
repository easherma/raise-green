    Raise Green will provide an online portal of financing and support by
    connecting communities with investors interested in putting their money to
    work -- protecting people and the planet. We will be listing solar projects
    for low to middle income populations then growing into other projects like
    electric vehicle infrastructure, diesel generator replacements, and
    microgrids.

intro:
  heading: Our Vision
  text: >+
    At Raise Green, we envision a healthy, just, and sustainable world where
    individuals can finance projects for low to middle income populations that
    fight climate change, reduce income inequality, and share in the ownership
    of renewable energy projects in their communities and across the country.
