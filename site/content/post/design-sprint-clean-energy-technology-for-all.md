Sponsored by [Acterra](https://www.acterra.org), this workshop will  address the problem of inequities in the adoption of clean energy technology such as solar panels in low-wealth communities in Silicon Valley. The facilitator, Allen Gunn of [Aspiration](https://aspirationtech.org), will lead the group through a fast- paced, hands-on, participatory “design sprint” to prototype innovative ways forward on access to clean energy technology for low-income communities.

This is an invitation-only gathering of 40 participants from across the stakeholder chain. Invited organizations include: CBOs such as: Dream Corps; Greenlining Institute; Benetech; Resilient By Design Bay Area; Center for Race, Poverty, and the Environment; Rising Sun Energy Center; Acterra; Climate Resolve; Menlo Spark; Silicon Valley Leadership Group; The People’s Plan; Belle Haven Action; Real Community Coalition; One East Palo Alto Clean energy advocacy orgs such as: GRID Alternatives; Build It Green; SunWork; RE-volv Public Agencies such as: BAAQMD; Silicon Valley Clean Energy; Peninsula Clean Energy Policy Advocates such as: Bay Area Works; NRDC; PolicyLink; SF Federal Reserve; Re:Focus Financial innovators such as: Beneficial State Foundation; HIP Investor; GoGreen Financing; Clean Energy Works Philanthropies such as: Packard Foundation; Heising-Simons Foundation; Sand Hill Foundation; Moore Foundation; Pacific Foundation Services; Energy Foundation; The San Francisco Foundation; Philanthropic Ventures; Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Corporates such as: Facebook; James Corner Field Operations; Google Individual community leaders and residents from stakeholder communities

Together the group will identify strategies and solutions to help us meet our collective goal of making clean energy technology available to all through a focus on: 

1. Storytelling – how might we bridge the communication gap between CBOs, funders, and low-income communities?
2. Funding models – how might we create innovative funding models for clean energy technology access for all?
3.  Metrics – how might we create metrics for success that speak to all stakeholders?

A whitepaper on outcomes of the day will be published and made freely available through Raise Green, Acterra, Aspiration, and other partner organizations.
