We were honored to speak at [Governor Brown's historic summit](https://www.globalclimateactionsummit.org), where thousands of individuals gathered to share historic climate commitments.

The gathering was designed specifically for non-state actors to gather and share ideas. 

Businesses, cities, states, and community organizations were represented in recognition of the necessity for action at all levels of society - cities, businesses, and community group. We cannot rely on waiting for national policies and need to do whatever we can in our daily lives and work towards reducing emissions, pollution, and income inequality.
